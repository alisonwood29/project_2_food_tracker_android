This was my second project at CodeClan. The aim of the project was as follows:

Goal: Practice OO and UI design with what we learned in Java / Android weeks

The brief for the project was:

Food Tracker

MVP
You are required to write an Android app that allows a user to track the food they eat. Users should be able to enter what they eat and when (date/time) and for what meal.

Goal: Practice what we learned in the Java / Android weeks and research how to persist data.

I chose this project as we hadn't seen any examples in class of a user entering data into an app. I was feeling comfortable with how Java worked and wanted to learn more about Android and I saw an opportunity for some self learning.

The homepage of my app is where the user inputs their meals and calories for the day. They can click onto another page that shows a list of all the meals by date and they can click on a specific one to show more information.

I had the logic of my app set up and then when it came to saving the data I taught myself about the Room Data Persistence Library to save the user input to a database. Room is an abstraction layer over SQLite and I found it really useful.

I also decided to teach myself to implement someone else's library in my project so I could display a pie chart of the days calories. This was more of a challenge.

I got a lot out of this project as I had the confidence to try and teach myself things we hadn't covered in class.

I am pleased that I got to grips with Android a lot more but I would like to change some of my models on this app so will revisit in the future.
